### KiCad project template for EEZ DIB peripheral modules

The project template makes it easy to start working on a new peripheral module and will need to be copied to your local KiCad template folder.

The template was created using symbols, footprints and 3D models from [eez-kicad-libraries](https://github.com/eez-open/eez-kicad-libraries), so for proper display it is recommended to install that plugin.

### Setting up the KiCad template folder

Start KiCad and in `Preferences` (1) open `Configure Paths...` (2) where you can see the currently configured Template path that you can change as desired.

### Copying a template and creating a new project from the template

Copy the complete contents of the template folder from this repository into it (e.g. `v1.2`)

Now you are ready to use the EEZ DIB template for your new project. To do this, you will need to select the `New Project from Template...` option from the `File` menu (3).
